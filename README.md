__CNN_Tensorflow.ipynb:__\
 A study of CNN's work on the task of classifying images of the CIFAR 10 dataset. Step-by-step construction of a neural network from a basic model with a single linear layer to a model with convolutional layers, batch normalization and dropout.\
The basic principles of building the architecture of convolutional neural networks are described.
