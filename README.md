__CNN_Tensorflow.ipynb:__\
 A study of CNN's work on the task of classifying images of the CIFAR 10 dataset. Step-by-step construction of a neural network from a basic model with a single linear layer to a model with convolutional layers, batch normalization and dropout.\
The basic principles of building the architecture of convolutional neural networks are described.\
\
__Dogs_v_Cat.ipynb__\
Using the pre-trained VGG16 model for binary classification.\
The notebook shows the basic steps of loading the adaptation of the model for a specific task, by replacing the output layers, retraining and validation on test data.\
\
__Gradient_boost_algoritms_for_CV.ipynb__\
Using classical machine learning models for classification tasks CV.\
A study of the operation of the gradient boosting algorithm of models based on the Gradient Histogram (HOG): XGboost, LightGBM, CatBoost.\
Prediction based on the PCA dimension reduction method.\
\
__The_Nature_Conservancy_Fisheries_Monitoring.ipynb__\
Classification of the catch based on camera images on a fishing vessel. Training a detector that finds fish in an image and classifies it into one of eight classes.
